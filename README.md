# Full Stack User Authentication System – (Task 1:- Prodigy Infotech)

## 📌 Overview

This project is a secure full-stack user authentication system built as part of Prodigy Infotech internship. It provides essential authentication features like user registration, login, logout, session handling, and JWT-based security.

## ✨ Features

- 📝 User Registration – New users can create an account securely.
- 🔑 Login Authentication – Existing users can log in using email & password.
- 🛡️ Password Hashing – Uses bcrypt/argon2 to securely store passwords.
- 🔒 JWT Authentication / Session Handling – Secure access to protected routes.
- 📧 Email Verification (Optional) – Verifies users via email link/OTP.
- 📱 Responsive UI – Built with a clean and user-friendly frontend.
- 🚀 Full Stack Implementation – Backend API + Database + Frontend integration.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Frontend: React.js, Tailwind 
- Backend: Node.js + Express.js 
- Database: MongoDB 
- Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) 
- Security: Bcrypt (for password hashing), Helmet, CORS
- Other Tools: Axios , Redux , Context API

## ⚙️ How It Works

   🔑 User Registration:-
-    User enters email & password.
-    Password is hashed and stored in database.

   🔑 Login:-
-    User logs in with credentials.
-    Server verifies password and generates a JWT/session token.

   🔑 Protected Routes:-
-    Only authenticated users can access certain routes/pages.

   🔑 Logout:-
- Token/session is destroyed, and user is logged out securely.
